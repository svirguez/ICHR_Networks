In terms of this network, the eigenvector centrality allow us to see what amici actors focus their participation on ‘popular’ cases, cases that atract interventions from well connected amici. We cannot say if their ‘strategic’ behavior is driven by the other participants (du to their popularity) or the impact of the substantive matter discussed in these cases.\nOn the other hand, the bonacich power centrality shows the actors that participated on the cases were no other people participated (therefore the actors with greater power of influence). All of these actrs has the same bonachich power score probably because they all filed a brief only once, for a case which wasn’t of interest for other actors:\n\n\n#top 5 bonacich power centrality\namici.nodes%>%\n  arrange(desc(bonpow))%>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n\n                                                    degree eigen\nInternational Legal Advisors Esq.                        2     0\nFoundation for the Development of International Law      2     0\nThe International Commission of Jurists                  2     0\nCatalina Martinez Coral                                  2     0\nFundacion Vida Solidaria                                 2     0\n                                                      bonpow\nInternational Legal Advisors Esq.                   3.927038\nFoundation for the Development of International Law 3.927038\nThe International Commission of Jurists             3.927038\nCatalina Martinez Coral                             3.927038\nFundacion Vida Solidaria                            3.927038\n\nBetwenness centrality and network constraint\nIn order to find the most influential actors in the amici network, it is is necessary to calculate both de closeness and betweenness centrality measures. The closeness centrality calculates the shortest paths between all nodes, then assigns each node a score based on its sum of shortest paths, this can help find good ‘broadcasters’. Meanwhile, betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes, which can help us to find the actors who influence the flow around a system.\nWe might expect that international organizations and well-funded actors have a greater participation in the Inter-American system, with an influential role among local and less endowed actors.\n\n\n#Closeness centrality\namici.nodes$close <- igraph::closeness(amici_ad)\n\namici.nodes%>%\n  arrange(desc(close))%>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n\n                               degree     eigen     bonpow\nWomen's Link Worldwide             66 0.0933683 -0.6017687\nYale University                   192 1.0000000 -0.6392321\nUNAM                              134 0.8920983 -0.5961262\nCenter for Reproductive Rights    116 0.9051396 -0.5626440\nInterights                        110 0.8835159 -1.4061725\n                                      close\nWomen's Link Worldwide         2.049516e-05\nYale University                2.049138e-05\nUNAM                           2.048509e-05\nCenter for Reproductive Rights 2.047251e-05\nInterights                     2.047167e-05\n\n#Betweenness centrality\namici.nodes$between<-igraph::betweenness(amici_ad, directed=FALSE)\n\namici.nodes%>%\n  arrange(desc(between))%>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n\n                       degree       eigen     bonpow        close\nWomen's Link Worldwide     66 0.093368302 -0.6017687 2.049516e-05\nCEJIL                     138 0.003024349 -0.6255743 2.045617e-05\nYale University           192 1.000000000 -0.6392321 2.049138e-05\nAmnesty International      96 0.002862279 -0.7003592 2.044739e-05\nUNAM                      134 0.892098273 -0.5961262 2.048509e-05\n                         between\nWomen's Link Worldwide 14257.860\nCEJIL                   9557.596\nYale University         8762.995\nAmnesty International   8186.167\nUNAM                    7470.614\n\nAs expected, international actors such as Amnesty International, Women’s Link Worldwide, and Interights are among the most influential actors. Likewise, although local, Yale University and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) are a good example of well-funded organization with enough capacity to influence the Inter-American system. Furthermore, CEJIL (Center for Justice and International Law) is precisely an organization aimed to contribute to the “full enjoyment of human rights in the Americas through the effective use of Inter-American System tools and other international human rights law protection mechanisms”.\nAs we can see, these centrality measures provide a better understanding of the most influential actors in the IAcHR network. Because this is a ‘undirected’ network, we cannot provide any measures of brockerage.\n\n\n\n",

Ties then connect\nthe actors to those cases. So, as bipartite network it is better to plot\nthe edges between the 2 types of nodes (the orange/circular nodes\nrepresent the amici actors, while the squared/blue nodes represent the\ncases):\n\n\nV(Aff_network)$color <- c(\"orange\", \"steel blue\")[V(Aff_network)$type+1]\nV(Aff_network)$shape <- c(\"circle\", \"square\")[V(Aff_network)$type+1]\n\nplot(Aff_network, vertex.label=NA, vertex.size=7, layout=layout.bipartite) \n\n\n\n\nDegree centrality by\nnode\nIn the last post, I presented centrality measures for the one matrix\n(actor x actor), which was aimed to show the ties between actors by\nvirtue of their participation in the same cases. Nevertheless, we saw\nthat actors such as the Colombian NGO ‘Dejusticia’ had a higher degree\nof centrality due to the fact that they participated in (only) one case\nwhere a greater number of other amici actors participated. These actors\nwere not central in the amici network, they just happen to be part of a\nreally famous case.\nSo, to have a better understanding of the centrality of the actors it\nis necessary to work with the affiliation network.\n\n\n#data frame for the nodes in the affiliation network\naff.nodes<-data.frame(name=V(Aff_network)$name, degree=igraph::degree(Aff_network))\n\n#data frame for the actors nodes\naff.nodes_amici <- aff.nodes[-c(404:482),]\n#data frame for the cases nodes\naff.nodes_cases <- aff.nodes[-c(1:403),]\n\n\n\nNow we can see the distribution of the centrality measures for each\ntypes of nodes. As you can see, both distributions are skewed towards\nzero, indicating the low degree centrality of the actors/cases.\n\n\n#distribution for actors\nhist(aff.nodes_amici$degree, main = \"Degree Distribution Actors to Cases\", xlab = \"# Cases in which an actor participated\")\n\n\n\n#distribution for cases\nhist(aff.nodes_cases$degree, main = \"Degree Distribution Cases to Actors\", xlab = \"# Actors that participated in the case\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see the actors and cases with the highest degree of\ncentrality in the affiliation network:\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#top 3 actors\narrange(aff.nodes_amici, desc(degree))%>%slice(1:3)\n\n\n                                                                                                         name\nAmnesty International                                                                   Amnesty International\nMinnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee\nThe International Human Rights Law Group                             The International Human Rights Law Group\n                                                       degree\nAmnesty International                                       9\nMinnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee      3\nThe International Human Rights Law Group                    3\n\n#top 3 cases\narrange(aff.nodes_cases, desc(degree))%>%slice(1:3)\n\n\n    name degree\n152  152     46\n203  203     41\n167  167     32\n\nAs expected, international organizations have a higher degree\ncentrality, that is participation in a higher number of cases, due to\nthe fact that they have political interests across different countries,\nwhile local NGOs focus on legal cases from their base country. In terms\nof the cases, it is possible to see that the ones that attracted a\ngreater number of amicus briefs were:\nArtavia Murillo et al. (“In vitro fertilization”) v. Costa Rica.\nThis case concerns human rights violations resulting from the State’s\ngeneral prohibition of the practice of in vitro fertilization.\nAtala Riffo and Daughters v. Chile. This case concerns the\ndiscriminatory treatment and arbitrary interference in the private and\nfamily life of a lesbian mother, Ms. Karen Atala Riffo.\nNogueira de Carvalho et al. V. Brazil. Murder of Gilson Nogueira de\nCarvalho, a lawyer and human rights defender and the State failure to\nundertake an effective investigation into his death and failed to punish\nthe responsible parties.\nEigenvector and Bonacich\npower centrality\nWe can also compare different measures of centrality, including the\neigen vector and Bonacich power. To do so, we need to add the data to\nthe data frame of each type of node\n\n\n#eigen vector centrality\ntemp<-centr_eigen(Aff_network,directed=F)\naff.nodes$eigen<-temp$vector\n\n#bonacich power centrality\naff.nodes$bonpow <- power_centrality(Aff_network, exponent = 0.9)\n\naff.nodes_amici <- aff.nodes[-c(404:482),]\naff.nodes_cases <- aff.nodes[-c(1:403),]\n\n\n\nThen we can plot the distribution of the three measures of\ncentrality. As you can see, there are not many central actors/cases in\nthis network\n\n\n#plot distribution centrality measures\nlibrary(ggplot2)\naff.nodes_amici%>%\n  select(-name) %>% \n  gather() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~key, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\nBecause the ties we are looking at are the connections between actors\nand cases, the eigenvector simply shows what actors are linked to the\nmost central or ‘popular’ cases. On the other hand, the bonacich power\ncentrality shows the actors that participated on the cases were no other\npeople participated (therefore the actors with greater power of\ninfluence).\n\n\n#top 3 actors with highest eigenvector centrality\narrange(aff.nodes_amici, desc(eigen))%>%\n  slice(1:3)\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     name\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)                                                                                                                                           Centro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)\nEnrique Pedro Haba, Professor at the Universidad de Costa Rica                                                                                                                                             Enrique Pedro Haba, Professor at the Universidad de Costa Rica\nSusie Talbot, Lawyer of the Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS) and Helen Duffy, Head Counsel of INTERIGHTS Susie Talbot, Lawyer of the Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS) and Helen Duffy, Head Counsel of INTERIGHTS\n                                                                                                                                     degree\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)                                                                           2\nEnrique Pedro Haba, Professor at the Universidad de Costa Rica                                                                            1\nSusie Talbot, Lawyer of the Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS) and Helen Duffy, Head Counsel of INTERIGHTS      1\n                                                                                                                                         eigen\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)                                                                      0.1577985\nEnrique Pedro Haba, Professor at the Universidad de Costa Rica                                                                       0.1473282\nSusie Talbot, Lawyer of the Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS) and Helen Duffy, Head Counsel of INTERIGHTS 0.1473282\n                                                                                                                                         bonpow\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)                                                                      -0.6041584\nEnrique Pedro Haba, Professor at the Universidad de Costa Rica                                                                       -0.3000833\nSusie Talbot, Lawyer of the Center for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS) and Helen Duffy, Head Counsel of INTERIGHTS -0.3000833\n\n#top 3 actors with highest bonacich power centrality\narrange(aff.nodes_amici, desc(bonpow))%>%\n  slice(1:3)\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                           name\nFernando Linares Beltranena                                                                                                         Fernando Linares Beltranena\nOscar Augusto Díaz Urquizú, former Director of the Treasury Police of Guatemala Oscar Augusto Díaz Urquizú, former Director of the Treasury Police of Guatemala\nThe International Commission of Jurists                                                                                 The International Commission of Jurists\n                                                                                degree\nFernando Linares Beltranena                                                          1\nOscar Augusto Díaz Urquizú, former Director of the Treasury Police of Guatemala      1\nThe International Commission of Jurists                                              1\n                                                                                eigen\nFernando Linares Beltranena                                                         0\nOscar Augusto Díaz Urquizú, former Director of the Treasury Police of Guatemala     0\nThe International Commission of Jurists                                             0\n                                                                                  bonpow\nFernando Linares Beltranena                                                     2.624369\nOscar Augusto Díaz Urquizú, former Director of the Treasury Police of Guatemala 2.624369\nThe International Commission of Jurists                                         2.624369\n\nFinally, we can correlate the different measures of centrality.

    "contents": "\nRecap\nBefore analyzing the degree and centrality of some of the nodes of the IAcHR network, lets recall briefly how I organized the network data in the previous post:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndata <- read.csv(\"CleanedData.csv\")\n#New column count\ndata$count <- 1\n\n#Gather the data at case level\nlev_data <- pivot_wider(data,id_cols = CaseID, names_from = `Name.of.Amicus`, values_from = count, values_fn = list(count = length), values_fill = list(count = 0))\n\n#Create the adjacency matrix\nmat <- as.matrix(lev_data[-1])\nad_matrix <- t(mat) %*% mat\n\n#Ignore the ties from a node to itself \ndiag(ad_matrix) <- 0\n\n\n\nUsing this matrix, I created an adjacency graph:\n\n\nlibrary(igraph)\namici_network <- graph.adjacency(ad_matrix, mode = \"undirected\", weighted = TRUE)\n\n\n\nAffiliation Network Data\nNevertheless, from previous posts we know that the amici data I am working with has the following characteristics:\nNodes: Actors (individuals or organizations) that have filed at least one amicus brief before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights\nTies: If an actor has filed a brief in the same case than other actor, there is a tie.\nAs you can see, the network is not based on a direct tie between the amici actors. They are connected by virtue of filing a brief in the same case. This means that we are dealing with an affiliation network, that is a network where the members are affiliated with one another based on co-membership in a group, or co-participation in some type of event (in this case the event is a legal case).\nThe affiliation is then organized as a 2-mode network, where amici actors are grouped by cases. We need to re-organize the matrix at the case level (see “lev_data” above) and create an ‘incidence’ matrix::\n\n\n#transpose lev_data to have amici grouped by case\nlibrary(data.table)\nT_lev_data <- transpose(lev_data,)\nrownames(T_lev_data) <- colnames(lev_data)\ncolnames(T_lev_data) <- lev_data$CaseID\nT_lev_data <- T_lev_data[-c(1),]\n\n\n\n2-mode neworkSo, in this affiliation network, there are two types of nodes: one type for the amici actors, and another type for the legal cases (case 16, case 18 …) to which the actors belong. Ties then connect the actors to those cases. In orther to work with this affiliation network in r, we need to create an ‘incidence’ graph.\nThe ‘graph.incidence’ function takes a matrix or data.frame and transforms it into an affiliation network, reading the rows as actors and the columns as the cases.\n\n\n#create graph using 'igraph'\nAff_network <- graph.incidence(T_lev_data)\n\n#description of the graph\n\n##size\nvcount(Aff_network)\n\n\n[1] 482\n\necount(Aff_network)\n\n\n[1] 421\n\n##ties\nis_bipartite(Aff_network)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_directed(Aff_network)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_weighted(Aff_network)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nOne-Mode matrix (actor x actor / case x case)\nIn order to study athe affiliation network, we need to study both types of nodes (actors and cases). To do this, it may be useful to examine the direct connections among the nodes of one type at a time by extracting the one-mode projections of the two-mode affiliation network:\n\n\n#extracting the one-mode projections \nAff_network.pr <- bipartite.projection(Aff_network)\nAff_network.pr\n\n\n$proj1\nIGRAPH b36202f UNW- 403 3615 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), weight (e/n)\n+ edges from b36202f (vertex names):\n[1] Amnesty International--Association of the Bar of the City of New York                                  \n[2] Amnesty International--Lawyers Committee for Human Rights                                              \n[3] Amnesty International-- The Central American Associaion of Families of Detained and Disappeared Persons\n[4] Amnesty International--Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee                          \n+ ... omitted several edges\n\n$proj2\nIGRAPH 83d6c75 UNW- 79 43 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), weight (e/n)\n+ edges from 83d6c75 (vertex names):\n [1] 18 --19  18 --20  18 --53  18 --82  18 --127 18 --190 18 --193\n [8] 18 --204 19 --20  19 --53  19 --82  19 --127 19 --190 19 --193\n[15] 19 --204 20 --53  20 --82  20 --127 20 --190 20 --193 20 --204\n[22] 22 --58  22 --85  53 --82  53 --127 53 --190 53 --193 53 --204\n[29] 53 --203 56 --102 58 --85  167--152 82 --127 82 --190 82 --193\n[36] 82 --204 99 --133 127--190 127--193 127--204 190--193 190--204\n[43] 193--204\n\nThen we can create two different adjacency graphs (actor x actor) (case x case) base on the projections\n\n\namici_net <- Aff_network.pr$proj1\ncase_net <- Aff_network.pr$proj2\n\namici_ad <- graph.adjacency(get.adjacency(amici_net, sparse = FALSE,attr = \"weight\"))\ncase_ad <- graph.adjacency(get.adjacency(case_net, sparse = FALSE,attr = \"weight\"))\n\n#describe both graphs\n##size\nvcount(amici_ad)\n\n\n[1] 403\n\necount(amici_ad)\n\n\n[1] 7244\n\nvcount(case_ad)\n\n\n[1] 79\n\necount(case_ad)\n\n\n[1] 96\n\nDensity, Degree, and Centrality of the Network\nUsing the adjacency graphs we can measure the network density and centralization:\n\n\n#density\ngraph.density(amici_ad)\n\n\n[1] 0.04471439\n\ngraph.density(case_ad)\n\n\n[1] 0.01557936\n\nIt is possible to see how both graphs (actorxactor/casexcase) have a really low densisity. That means that most of amici actors do not oftenly file amicus briefs in the same cases (likewise, cases are not usually tied by amici interventions). This is understandable given the fact that cases come from different countries, and amici actors tend to be local organizations or individuals, so it is unlikely that they participate in cases from other countries.\nThis finding is also confirmed by lower level of centralization of the actor x actor graph, which shows that th eamici actors have a lower level of cohesion or integration between each other:\n\n\ncentr_degree(amici_ad, loops = FALSE, mode = \"total\")$centralization\n\n\n[1] 0.1450602\n\nIn order to analize the degree and centrality of the amici actors, we first create a dataset with the name a degree of all the nodes in this graph. Then we can see how the distribution of node degree for the amici actor network, based on what we already have seen, has a long tail on the left.\n\n\namici.nodes<-data.frame(name=V(amici_ad)$name, degree=igraph::degree(amici_ad))\n\n#distribution\nhist(amici.nodes$degree, main = \"Amici Influence: Degree Distribution\", xlab = \"Times filed a brief with other actor\")\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most of the actors have a lower degree, it is interesting to see that some organizations have an outstanding degree level:\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\narrange(amici.nodes, desc(degree))%>%slice(1:3)\n\n\n                                                                                                                           name\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA) Centro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)\nCenter for Justice and International Law                                               Center for Justice and International Law\nAmnesty International                                                                                     Amnesty International\n                                                                degree\nCentro de Estudios of Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (DEJUSTICIA)    152\nCenter for Justice and International Law                           102\nAmnesty International                                               94\n\nIt is not surprising that international organizations such as Amnesty International or the Center for International Law have higher degree, since they have political interest over several countries and more (in contrast with local NGOs) as well as more resources. What is interesting is the prominence of Dejusticia, a Colombian NGO with the highest score of degree centrality. As a local advocacy organization one might expect a minor involvement in legal cases outside of its base country; nevertheless it would be interesting to explore what is the reason behind its degree centrality.\n\n\n\n",

This dataset of amici actors has 425 observations of 2 variables (“Name of Amicus” and “Case ID”), indicating in which cases an amici actor participated in:\nA view of the dataset on amiciFrom raw data to an adjacency matrix\nIn order to work with this dataset, I need to put the data into a format that is suitable for network analysis. So, after cleaning the data, I create an adjacency matrix (nxn) where I can see how many times interveners have filed an amicus brief in the same case than each other. I asigned “0” to the diagonal of the matrix to ignore the ties from a node to itself.\n\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"CleanedData.csv\")\n\n#New column count\ndata$count <- 1\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n#Gather the data at case level\nlev_data <- pivot_wider(data,id_cols = CaseID, names_from = `Name.of.Amicus`, values_from = count, values_fn = list(count = length), values_fill = list(count = 0))\n\n#Create the adjacency matrix\nmat <- as.matrix(lev_data[-1])\nad_matrix <- t(mat) %*% mat\ndiag(ad_matrix) <- 0\n\n\n\nAdjacency matrixDescribing the network dataset\nBefore describing the network dataset, I need first to create a network object from the dataset loaded (the adjacency network):\n\n\nlibrary(igraph)\namici_network <- graph.adjacency(ad_matrix, mode = \"undirected\", weighted = TRUE)\n\nis_directed(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_weighted(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_bipartite(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nNow, I can identify and describe content of nodes and links, and identify format of data set, Of course, from the previous steps we know that this a matrix, symmetric, and weighted. This means that each time there is a connection between two amici, each of them is filing a briefe before the court (symetrical), but these ties among amici are valued according to how many time they have intervened in the same cases.\nWe can also identify the network attributes:\n\n\n#size\nvcount(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] 403\n\necount(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] 3615\n\n#attributes names and content\nvertex_attr_names(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] \"name\"\n\nedge_attr_names(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] \"weight\"\n\nhead(V(amici_network)$name)\n\n\n[1] \"Fernando Linares Beltranena\"                                                     \n[2] \"Amnesty International\"                                                           \n[3] \"Association of the Bar of the City of New York\"                                  \n[4] \"Lawyers Committee for Human Rights\"                                              \n[5] \" The Central American Associaion of Families of Detained and Disappeared Persons\"\n[6] \"Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee\"                          \n\nhead(E(amici_network)$weight)\n\n\n[1] 2 2 1 3 1 1\n\nIt is also possible to describe the network structure:\n\n\n#Dyad census: because the ties are undirected we will expect that there is no assymetrical edges\nigraph::dyad.census(amici_network)\n\n\n$mut\n[1] 3615\n\n$asym\n[1] 0\n\n$null\n[1] 77388\n\n#Triad census\nigraph::triad_census(amici_network)\n\n\n [1] 9455588       0 1331612       0       0       0       0       0\n [9]       0       0    2600       0       0       0       0   37601\n\nIn terms of transitivity or global clustering, it is possible to see how the proption of connected triads in the network of amici that are complete is hight, meaning that almost all connected triads are transitive. Likewise, the local clustering coefficient (emphasis on low degree nodes) confirms the high transitivity of the network:\n\n\n#global clustering\ntransitivity(amici_network)\n\n\n[1] 0.9774703\n\n#local clustering coefficient\ntransitivity(amici_network, type=\"average\")\n\n\n[1] 0.9920321\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIAcHRHave interest groups in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IAcHR) come to work together? How have their coalition strategies changed over time? The increasing legitimacy of amici participation in national courts have paved the way for interest groups (particularly nongovernmental organizations) to increase amici advocacy before international courts (Johnson and Amerasinghe 2009). Amicus briefs are perceived as one of the most effective and less costly methods of legal advocacy to nonjudicial actors (Krislov 1963). For this reason, scholars have begun to construct networks based on amicus briefs. Nevertheless, as Box-Steffensmeier et. al. (2017) have argued, these constructions provide little clue as to who works with whom and how interest actors change their coalition strategies over time.\nTo address these questions, I want to undertake an empirical study based on a new database on the IAcHR rulings compiled by the PluriCourts project of the University of Oslo (Stiansen, Naurin, and Bøyum 2020). I will update their Dataset on amici actors (See file “IACtHRamici.RDATA”) to include some new cases decided by the IAcHR and turn it into network data. This specific dataset has 425 observations of 2 variables (“Name of Amicus” and “Case ID”), indicating in which cases an amici actor participated in.\n\n\n\n",
